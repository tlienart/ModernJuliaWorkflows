# Writing Julia code

<!-- \toc -->

## Installation

```julia:version
#hideall
print(VERSION)
```

The most natural (but not the best) way to install Julia is the [downloads page](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
Don't forget to also read the platform-specific instructions for [Windows](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#windows), [macOS](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#macos) or [Linux](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#linux_and_freebsd).
This official page is where you will find the "current stable release", which everyone should use by default.
At the time of writing, it is version \textoutput{version}.
But of course new versions are released regularly, and you will need to keep up.
On the other hand, you may want to test your code on older versions and ensure compatibility.

There is an easy solution to manage multiple Julia versions on your computer, and it is called [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup).
You can get it from the [Windows store](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#windows), or install it from the [command line](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#mac-and-linux) on Unix systems.
It provides [various utilities](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#using-juliaup) to organize, update and switch between Julia versions.
As a bonus, you no longer have to specify the path to your Julia executable: juliaup takes care of that for you.

The main thing to understand about juliaup is that it provides adaptive shortcuts called "channels", which allow you to access specific Julia versions without giving their exact number.
The most important ones are:
* `release`, which is bound to the [current stable release](https://julialang.org/downloads/#current_stable_release);
* `lts`, which is bound to the [long-term support version](https://julialang.org/downloads/#long_term_support_release).
* `rc`, which is bound to the upcoming release candidate;

For instance, you can install the LTS version with
```bash
juliaup add lts
```
When new versions are tagged, the binding of a given channel can change, and a new executable might need to be downloaded.
If you want to catch up with the latest developments, all it takes is to run
```bash
juliaup update
```
If you want an overview of the channels installed on your computer, just use
```bash
juliaup status
```
